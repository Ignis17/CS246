Given 2 integer arrays, A and B with integers in the range of 1-100.
Assume the size of A is 15 and the size of B is 20.
Write functions for union and intersection that store the values in a third array, C.

That is C = A union B and then C = A intersection B.

This assignment will be used in the bag class discussion.
Make sure that you include asserts as needed to test your code and also provide documentation on your test cases.
