It was during the battle of Document when I was running through a Bureau
when a Cashew went off right next to my platoon. Our Art Director yelled for
us to Gloat to the nearest Guadalajara we could find. When we got to the
Guadalajara we Blustered to start a fire. As we were starting the fire the enemy
saw the Task from the fire and started Swooning Banks at us. we all quickly
ducked behind the Rug at the Guadalajara and returned fire. we quickly
eliminated the enemy and were Sad that we had won the battle.
