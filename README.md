# CS246 (Discrete Data Structures) - Medgar Evers College(Spring 2018)
##  Course Description:
*This course introduces the different ways that data is organized 
and stored in computer memory and the relevant procedures 
used in the manipulation of that data. The idea of abstract data 
types (ADTs) is first introduced, and then reinforced through the 
characterization of fundamental data structures in the discipline - 
stacks, queues, and trees. Other topics are recursive algorithms, 
dynamic storage, and complexity. Algorithms for searching and 
sorting are also implemented.*
